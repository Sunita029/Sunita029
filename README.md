Hi there! I'm a Data science enthusiast with 5.6 years of experience and a passion for turning data into actionable insights. With 2 years of experience in software development and 3.6 years in data science, I've developed a unique skill set that enables me to create robust, scalable solutions that help organizations make better decisions.

When I'm not knee-deep in code, you can find me writing about data science and technology on Medium. I believe that sharing knowledge is key to growing and learning, and I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to connect with others in the field.

I have a strong background in SQL, Python, and Artificial Intelligence and I'm always fascinated by the endless possibilities that data presents. Whether I'm working on a complex data pipeline or exploring a new data set, I'm driven by the challenge of finding meaningful insights and making data work for my clients.

As I continue to grow my career in data science, I'm eager to tackle new challenges and explore new frontiers in this ever-evolving field. Let's connect and see where our shared passion for data takes us!
